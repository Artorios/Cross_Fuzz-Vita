Cross_Fuzz-Vita
===============

Cross_Fuzz modified specifically for the PSVita

Original Cross_Fuzz blog post: http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2011/01/announcing-crossfuzz-potential-0-day-in.html

Usage: Simply upload this somewhere or host a local webserver and direct the Vita browser to fuzz.html, click START! and let the two popups open, then go back to the main window

TODO: Right now it can be considered a simple PoC. Working on proper APIs for streaming data over to a PC as per wololo's suggestion to try to keep PSVita and PS4 codebases similar.
